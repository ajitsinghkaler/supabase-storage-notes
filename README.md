# Supabase Storage Codebase Notes

This repository contains my detailed study notes and analysis of the [Supabase Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage) codebase (version 1.15.2).

## Overview

These notes document my exploration and understanding of the Supabase Storage implementation. They serve as a reference for developers interested in:
- Understanding what happens in each file of Supabase Storage
- Exploring the codebase structure

## Repository Structure

- `rough-notes/` - Contains raw notes exported from Notion, documenting my initial analysis and observations
- *(Coming Soon)* Detailed articles covering:
  - System Architecture Overview
  - Design Patterns and Implementation Details
  - Key Components and Their Interactions

## Note

The current notes in the `rough-notes` directory are preliminary observations and may contain unstructured content due to the Notion-to-Markdown export process. More polished and organized articles is in progress.

## Version Information

These notes correspond to Supabase Storage version `1.15.2`. Please note that the current implementation might differ if you're using a more recent version.

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you find any inaccuracies or have suggestions for improvements.
