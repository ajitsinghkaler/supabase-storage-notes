Lock notifier it notifies when a release happens when subscription happens. For locking we check if we can aquire a lock in 5 seconds set the inner resolve of the lock and on delete run the stop function provided. For aquiring a lock we must aquire it on a certain file.

server

On tus server we extend it to add 2 abort controller 

```
// Initialize two AbortControllers:
// 1. `requestAbortController` for instant request termination, particularly useful for stopping clients to upload when errors occur.
// 2. `abortWithDelayController` to introduce a delay before aborting, allowing the server time to complete ongoing operations.
// This is particularly useful when a future request may need to acquire a lock currently held by this request.
```

upload-id

We create a valid upload id from a string or file as needed.
