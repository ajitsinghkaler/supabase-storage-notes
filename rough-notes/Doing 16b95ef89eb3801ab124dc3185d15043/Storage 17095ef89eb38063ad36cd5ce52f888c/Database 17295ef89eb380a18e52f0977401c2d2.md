# Database

adapter.ts

This is the interface for implementing a database if we want to additional database interface other khan knex later.

database.ts

its the only source of truth for interacting with the storage database. With transaction we get a connection with knex in a trasaction so thta all commit or none we set its scope and run the transactiopn with the function provided. to check permission we check if certain operation can be performed ythis is done via performing a trasaction and always throwing in it with the result of that operation. for creating a bucket we run a create buket query with appropriate data.  rest everything is same running on db with knex. Potgres advisory locks which are on application level and mean anythung if there is a lock and another tries to fetch it it fails automatically it is used for tus when its doing reusmeable uploads. There ius also wait for local which waits to aquire the lock otherwise it fails immediately. based on error code we generate from postgres we generate the appropriarte error message
