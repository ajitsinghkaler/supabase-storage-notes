# Stream

byte-counter.ts

Here we count the bustes that are processes through a stream we keep adding bytes to stream until it completes.

stream-speed.ts

we check the emit speed by calculating lastinterval bytes that it sent divided by its freqency. Frequency is the time in sec and lastinterval bytes are the total bytes moved in thios interval. When data passes we calculates bytes passes  and on close we do cleanup of all listencers

monitor.ts

in this we implement all of above for calculating speed. making traces of it on and start clenup when it loses.
