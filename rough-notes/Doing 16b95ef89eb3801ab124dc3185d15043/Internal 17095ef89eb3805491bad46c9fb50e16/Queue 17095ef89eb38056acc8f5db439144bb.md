# Queue

database.ts

We extend event emitter to handle async events. we implemented it like this becuase this is the way that pg-boss queue is implemnted. when we open we open with outr cobnfig. on exit we end pool in eqecuteSql we execute the sql needed if there is pool and connnection is open.

event.ts

This creates base event to send to queue. In batch send we pass it meesage get queue options and add add it to the queue using insert. In send if pgqueue not avilable send error with payload for metrics after that using queue instyance we send event we log metrics if it fails we log metrics too.  In get slow retry queue we retry  with 30 minutes delay and set retry backoff. there are lkot of static methods too which can be overwrtten to do some things whole doing something.

Queue.ts

For starting a queue if we have pgBoss available we return it.Otherwise we built a new pgBoss and start it and we create logs and eoor on error. With regiter you send events. With stop you stop and call all events on close method with promise. We convert events to promises and refiter them in queue or show retry queue. To register a task we we process the job if it has onMesage we run it if it fails send it to slow retry queue if enabled.
