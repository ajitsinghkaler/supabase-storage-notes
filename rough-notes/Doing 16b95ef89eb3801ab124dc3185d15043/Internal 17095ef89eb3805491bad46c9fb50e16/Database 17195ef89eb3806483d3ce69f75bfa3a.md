We maintain a cache of db connections with a cleanup function. We define the role in tenant connection. To stop we create an array of connections promises and we cloose each one of them when all are setted we close it . For creating we check if we already have a connection otherwise we crete a new knex pool do some logging and add it to connections.  With set scope we set session vaiuables for role user.  usper user we set transaction connection of a superuser roles. In transaction we return the trasaction of the knexDb connection with async retry Then we write a workaround so taht if tehre is error it bubbles.

To get s3 creds we gett them store in cache if in cache then return otherwise return them from db.
